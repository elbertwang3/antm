					<h1>How to spot a frontrunner on America's Next Top Model</h1>

					<p> TyTy's back, baby. After 22 <strike>seasons</strike> cycles of America's Next Top model, the CW network cancelled the long-running series at the end of 2015 due to dwindling ratings. When VH1 revived the series a year later, singer Rita Ora took over as head judge for cycle 23. But the show just wasn't the same. Tyra was the face and heart of the franchise, and fans <a href="images/rootingforyou.gif">begged for her to come back</a>. Now she's reprising her role as head judge for Cycle 24. In honor of her return, I've decided to comb through 23 cycles and 296 contestants worth of data, reliving every tearful exit and crowning of a new model along with them. </p>
					<br>
					<br>

					<p> In the beginning, ANTM seemed like an earnest attempt in launching the careers of <a href="images/undiscovered.gif">undiscovered supermodels</a>. However, over the course of 14 years, it's dubious whether ANTM <a href="http://gawker.com/5942709/americas-next-top-model-winner-caridee-english-describes-how-sucky-it-is-to-win-antm">has actually helped produce successful models</a>. Still, the show is such a staple of reality TV that it has become ingrained in pop culture. Every week, America tuned in to see what Tyra might <a href="images/tyrafaint.gif">do</a> <a href="images/tongue.gif">next</a> or what <a href="images/smize.gif">new</a> <a href="images/bootytooch.gif">word</a> she might make up. But part of the original appeal of the show was watching tall, gangly ugly ducklings transform into models in a matter of weeks. Each week, contestants participated in challenges and photoshoots, and their performance determined whether they stayed or went home. Most importantly, they also received a call-out order at panel, providing me with all the quantitative data I need to figure out exactly what it takes to be <a href="images/ontop.gif">on top</a>. </p>
						
					<h3> A Survey </h3>
					<p> Contestants usually apply to the show through by sending in a video audition or attending a casting call, but some were scouted from Myspace, at a homeless shelter, and even from an ice cream truck. However they were found, their fates all fall into neatly defined categories. </p>

					<div class="graph" id="bubblesgraph">
						<h5> The outcome of every ANTM contestant</h5>
						<p> Most contestants end up being eliminated at panel, which at the time may seem like the end of the world and their modeling careers, but as they say, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_POQOE-kyY"> one end is a new beginning</a>. Despite some contestants <a href="https://youtu.be/lKd5heULJGY?t=166">vowing to win the competition</a>, only 7.8% of the contestants make it out on top. Cycle 1's Elyse <a href="images/modelingcontract.gif">put it best</a>. Others were not so lucky. Some were eliminated in a challenge outside of panel, Cycle 21's Romeo was disqualified for <a href="images/headbump.gif">a physical altercation</a>, and Cycle 17's Angelea won her cycle only to be disqualified for her past as an escort. Others even quit the competition, deciding that modeling wasn't for them or because they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=220PxtwO9QI">refused a makeover</a>.

						<h5> Where the girls come from </h5>
						<p> This is <i>America's</i> Next Top Model, after all. California is the most represented state overall, but rural North Dakota and Arkansas have had two winners apiece. Almost all states have been represented on the show, barring Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Half the contestants on Cycle 18: British Invasion were from the UK, and they have been omitted.</p>

					<h3> Eliminations </h3>
					<p> At the end of every week, contestants attended panel where the esteemed judges <strike>destroyed the self-esteem of</strike> imparted <a href="images/hoefashion.gif">valuable</a>  <a href="images/911.jpg"> modeling</a> <a href="images/hoefashion2.gif"> advice</a> to bright-eyed model wannabes. Each week, the judges eliminated the contestant with the poorest performance. 
					<h5> The Journey to the Top </h5>
					<p> I wanted to visualize each contestant's journey during their cycle by mapping their line to their call-out order from week to week. Performance at each week's photoshoot usually carries the most weight in determining a contestant's call-out order, but sometimes the judges consider external factors--such as confidence or how badly they want to win the competition--as reasons to rank someone higher or save someone from elimination. If a line is cut short, that contestant was eliminated from the competition that week.</p>
					
					<div class="graph" id="calloutgraph">

					</div>
					<p> In some cycles, the obvious front-runner won the competition, like Jourdan from Cycle 20 or Nicole from Cycle 13. Other winners had a rockier road to the top, like Lisa from Cycle 17 or  The judges can be unpredictable and fickle, and fans sometimes complain that some contestants </p>
					<h3> The First Call-out Advantage </h3>
					<p> Each week, the judges award the first call-out to the contestant with the best photo that week. Some contestants bumble their way through the photoshoot only to get lucky with an amazing shot, while other contestants solidify their lead by taking consistently good photos from week to week.</p>
					<div class="graph" id="mostFCO">
						<h5> How the girl(s) with the most first call-outs of their cycle placed </h5>
						<p> Below is a graph of the 34 contestants with the most first call-outs of their respective cycles. Some cycles had ties, and all tied contestants have been included in those cases, which is why more than 23 are shown. My theory is that while the winner of each cycle needs to do well at photoshoots, the winner often doesn't have the most first call-outs. In only 11 out of the 23 cycles, the winner either tied with or had the most first call-outs of their cycle. Sometimes, a performance at the final runway show or some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYCpEkw0LVM">je ne sais quoi</a> about a contestant will sway the judges toward an underdog. </p>

					</div>
					<div class="graph" id="whogoeshome">
						<h5> Who goes home? </h5>
						<p> I decided to test whether average call-out order had an effect on which of the two bottom two contestants would be eliminated in any given week; namely, whether having a better average call-out would save a contestant from elimination. I've included 240 eliminations from all the cycles (I've ommitted the first week of each cycle because contestants don't have a prior average call-out in the first week), and these are the results. Contestants who had a better (lower numerical value) call-out order were saved 55.4% of the time, whereas contestants with the worse call-out average was saved 37.9% of the time. In the rest of the cases, contestants had an equal callout average at the time of elimination.</p>


						<svg id="whogoeshomesvg" width='960' height='500'></svg>
						<p> Although having a better average call-out is definitely an advantage when you're in the bottom two, it had less of an effect than I had expected. Sometimes the judges may see a potential in a contestant that has yet to be explored, and they may save a contestant with a poorer past performance for that reason. </p>

						<p> The green bubbles on the left can be interpreted as "unfair" eliminations, especially the ones with a large difference in averages. In Cycle 7, Jaeda and A.J. landed in the bottom two in the 6th episode. Although Jaeda had an average call-out of 7.75 and AJ an average of 3, A.J. ended up going home. Jaeda would end up landing in the bottom two four times. </p>

						<h5> How many first call-outs does it take to win? </h5>
						<p> Below, each donut represents all the contestants with x number of first call-outs. Each slice represents a placement, the size of the slice represents how many contestants had that specific placement, and the darker the color of each slice, the farther those contestants made it in the competition. The first call-out for the decision between the winner and the runner-up has been omitted. </p>

						<p> There has been no winner without at least one callout. One first call-out is enough for the judges to notice the potential in a contestant, but it's often not enough to win. Three first-callouts and a contestant is almost guaranteed to get a spot in the final three. Joanie from Cycle 6 and Anya from Cycle 10 had <i> five</i> first call-outs a piece, but still ended up as runner-ups of their respective cycles. Winner Ann Ward from Cycle 16 took her cycle by storm, earning a record five consecutive first call-outs in the first five episodes, and ended up with six total. She is the only one to have earned six first call-outs, not counting the finale.</p>

					<h3> The Dreaded Bottom Two </h3>
					<div class="graph" id="earlybottomtwo">
						<h5> Is an early bottom two a death sentence? </h5>
						<svg id="earlybottomtwograph" width='800' height='600'></svg>
						
						<p>An early bottom two is hard to interpret--it could either signal a model who lacks natural talent and is on their way out, or a model with potential waiting to be discovered in the coming weeks, like Shannon from Cycle 2 or _____, who landed in the bottom two in the first week. While an early bottom two certainly isn't a death sentence, a consecutive bottom two is. Out of 81 consecutive bottom two appearances, only 26 survive the second bottom two, a 32% chance of survival. Only two models have survived <i>three</i> consecutive bottom twos: Erin from Cycle 13 and Devin from Cycle 22.</p>

					<h3> What I took away </h3>
					Winners are not always the frontrunners
					bottom two two weeks in a row = bye, unforgivable
					missing a photoshoot = bye
